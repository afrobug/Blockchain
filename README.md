What Is a Blockchain?

A blockchain is a distributed database or ledger that is shared among the nodes of a computer network. As a database, a blockchain stores information electronically in digital format. Blockchains are best known for their crucial role in cryptocurrency systems, such as Bitcoin, for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions. The innovation with a blockchain is that it guarantees the fidelity and security of a record of data and generates trust without the need for a trusted third party.

Purpose <<<

Main use case is proof of ownership
for example real estate which includes information such as:
when the house was built
multiple ownerships
to the current owner

this same principle applies to anything with substantial value

Not just ownership its purpose expands to keeping track of the supply chain

if applied to products groceries to the level where people can track what farm it came from

History of Blockchain <<<

Blockchain isn’t just a database, it’s a new technology stack with ‘digital trust’ that is revolutionizing the way we exchange value and information across the internet, by taking out the ‘gatekeepers’ from the process.

Blockchain history goes back farther than you might imagine, but we’ve condensed it by answering four critical questions:

How Does a Blockchain Work? <<<

The goal of blockchain is to allow digital information to be recorded and distributed, but not edited. In this way, a blockchain is the foundation for immutable ledgers, or records of transactions that cannot be altered, deleted, or destroyed. This is why blockchains are also known as a distributed ledger technology (DLT).

Transparency
Because of the decentralized nature of Bitcoin’s blockchain, all transactions can be transparently viewed by either having a personal node or using blockchain explorers that allow anyone to see transactions occurring live. Each node has its own copy of the chain that gets updated as fresh blocks are confirmed and added. This means that if you wanted to, you could track Bitcoin wherever it goes. 

For example, exchanges have been hacked in the past, where those who kept Bitcoin on the exchange lost everything. While the hacker may be entirely anonymous, the Bitcoins that they extracted are easily traceable. If the Bitcoins stolen in some of these hacks were to be moved or spent somewhere, it would be known.

Of course, the records stored in the Bitcoin blockchain (as well as most others) are encrypted. This means that only the owner of a record can decrypt it to reveal their identity (using a public-private key pair). As a result, users of blockchains can remain anonymous while preserving transparency.


Types of Blockchains <<<

There are four types of blockchains:

1. Public Blockchains
Public blockchains are open, decentralized networks of computers accessible to anyone wanting to request or validate a transaction (check for accuracy). Those (miners) who validate transactions receive rewards.

Public blockchains use proof-of-work or proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms (discussed later). Two common examples of public blockchains include the Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) blockchains.

2. Private Blockchains
Private blockchains are not open, they have access restrictions. People who want to join require permission from the system administrator. They are typically governed by one entity, meaning they’re centralized. For example, Hyperledger is a private, permissioned blockchain.

3. Hybrid Blockchains or Consortiums
Consortiums are a combination of public and private blockchains and contain centralized and decentralized features. For example, Energy Web Foundation, Dragonchain, and R3.

Take note: There isn’t a 100 percent consensus on whether these are different terms. Some make a distinction between the two, while others consider them the same thing.

4. Sidechains
A sidechain is a blockchain running parallel to the main chain. It allows users to move digital assets between two different blockchains and improves scalability and efficiency. An example of a sidechain is the Liquid Network.

Pros and Cons of Blockchain <<<

For all of its complexity, blockchain’s potential as a decentralized form of record-keeping is almost without limit. From greater user privacy and heightened security to lower processing fees and fewer errors, blockchain technology may very well see applications beyond those outlined above. But there are also some disadvantages.

Pros
Improved accuracy by removing human involvement in verification

Cost reductions by eliminating third-party verification

Decentralization makes it harder to tamper with

Transactions are secure, private, and efficient

Transparent technology

Provides a banking alternative and a way to secure personal information for citizens of countries with unstable or underdeveloped governments

Cons
Significant technology cost associated with mining bitcoin

Low transactions per second

History of use in illicit activities, such as on the dark web

Regulation varies by jurisdiction and remains uncertain

Data storage limitations
