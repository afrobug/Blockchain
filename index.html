        <b>Benefits of Blockchains Over Traditional Finance</b>

        <br> <br> <br>
        <a>Trustless:</a> The blockchain is immutable and automates trusted transactions between counterparties who do
        not need
        to know each other. Transactions are only executed when programmed conditions are met by both parties.
        Unstoppable: Once the conditions programmed into a blockchain protocol are met, an initiated transaction cannot
        be undone, changed, or stopped. It’s going to execute and nothing – no bank, government, or third party – can
        stop it.
        <br> <br>
        <a>Immutable:</a> Records on a blockchain cannot be changed or tampered with – Bitcoin has never been hacked. A
        new
        block of transactions is only added after a complex mathematical problem is solved and verified by a consensus
        mechanism. Each new block has a unique cryptographic key resulting from the previous block’s information and key
        being added into a formula.
        <br> <br>
        <a>Decentralized:</a> No single entity maintains the network. Unlike centralized banks, decisions on the
        blockchain are
        made via consensus. Decentralization is essential because it ensures people can easily access and build on the
        platform, and there are multiple points of failure.
        <br> <br>
        <a>Lower Cost:</a> In the traditional finance system, you pay third parties like banks to process transactions.
        The
        blockchain eliminates these intermediaries and reduces fees, with some systems returning fees to miners and
        stakers.
        <br> <br>
        <a>Peer-to-Peer:</a> Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, let you send money directly to anyone, anywhere in the
        world,
        without an intermediary like a bank charging transaction or handling fees.
        Transparent: Public blockchains are open-source software, so anyone can access them to view transactions and
        their source code. They can even use the code to build new applications and suggest improvements to the code.
        Suggestions are accepted or rejected via consensus.
        <br> <br>
        <a>Universal Banking:</a> 2 Billion people globally do not have a bank account. Because anyone can access the
        blockchain to store money, it’s a great way to bank the unbanked and protect against theft that can happen due
        to holding cash in physical locations.

        <b>Promising Blockchain Use Cases and Killer Applications</b>
        <br> <br> <br>
        Blockchain technology is currently used across various industries like supply chain, healthcare, retail, media
        and advertising, financial services, insurance, travel and transportation, oil and gas, and gaming.
        <br> <br>
        Here are some promising use cases:
        <br> <br>
        Cryptocurrencies: The ‘killer app’ of blockchains today is internet money. Cryptocurrencies let you transfer
        value faster and cheaper across borders without a bank. Besides Bitcoin and Ethereum, other digital currency
        examples include Polkadot (DOT), NEO, Cardano (ADA), Tether (USDT), Binance Coin (BNB), and Litecoin (LTC).
        Smart Contracts: These blockchain applications are contracts that automatically execute without an intermediary
        once conditions written into the computer code are met.


        <div class="network">
            <img src="images/img5.png">
        </div>

        <br> <br>
        Decentralized Banking: The use of blockchain technology is also proliferating in banking. For example, many
        banks like Barclays, Canadian Imperial Bank, and UBS are interested in how blockchain can make their back-office
        settlement systems more efficient.
        <br> <br>
        Video Games/Art: You may have heard Crypto Kitties—a game launched on the Ethereum blockchain. One of the
        virtual pets in the game was sold for over $100,000.
        <br> <br>
        Peer-to-peer Energy Trading: People buy or sell energy directly without an intermediary.
        Supply chain and logistics tracking: Blockchain is being used to track precious metals’ origins and foods. For
        example, Walmart and IBM worked together to create a food traceability system based on open-source ledger
        technology, making it easier to trace contaminated food.
        <br> <br>
        Healthcare process optimization: Blockchain can speed up the time required to pay health insurance payments to
        patients and store and securely share medical data and records.
        <br> <br>
        Real estate processing platform: Property ownership records can be securely stored and verified on the
        blockchain. These records cannot be tampered with, so you can trust they’re accurate and more easily verify
        property ownership.
        <br> <br>
        NFT marketplaces: These are marketplaces that allow you to buy nonfungible tokens (NFTs): digital tokens of
        things like paintings and clothing.
        <br> <br>
        Music royalties tracking: Blockchain can trace music streams and immediately pay those who contributed to a
        song.
        <br> <br>
        Anti-money laundering tracking system: Authorities can more easily track the original source of money because
        every transaction on the blockchain is recorded and leaves behind a tamper-proof trail.

        </div>

        <br> <br>
        Personal identity security: Traditional systems for storing identities are insecure and fragmented. Blockchain
        provides a unified, immutable, and interoperable infrastructure so you can store and manage records securely and
        efficiently.
        <br> <br>
        New insurance distribution methods: For example, peer-to-peer insurance, parametric insurance, and
        microinsurance.
        <br> <br>
        Automated Advertising Campaigns: Advertisers can use smart contracts to automate advertising campaigns, e.g., an
        audience is only shown an ad when specific criteria are met.

            <p>
                While we understand that blockchain technology will
                remain a complex topic for many, it really doesn’t have to be for you.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>With many promising real-world use cases like faster cross-border payments and smart contracts,
                blockchain
                technology is here to stay.

                As more companies realize how the blockchain can help them, they’ll commit more resources, money, and
                time
                into the technology—and even more use cases will emerge.
